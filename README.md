# Project Overview
## Vision & Goals
Enable Housing providers to implement a self service solution for their customers to manage their tenancy. Eventually this would enable clients to complete the following tasks;
* Make a new complaint
* Check on ongoing complaint
* Report a repair
* Report a communal repair

## Project Vertical
This solution will be compatible with both NPSP and Non Profit Cloud.
